Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range?
   (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with
    to the most you think you're worth.)
   $58,000-62,000

2. When can you start?
   Within 30 days after accepting an offer. October 6th at earliest.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next
   six months that we should know about?
   No

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?
   No, I have a dog too.

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted,
   Halloween or otherwise.
   I was a mummy for halloween a few years ago. I wore tight-fitting 
   clothes. Then I was wrapped in fabric strips. I had white makeup 
   covering my face and dark circles around my eyes. It was very cold
   that day (around 30 degrees), but I didn't wear a jacket, because 
   I didn't want to cover up my costume. It's not cool to go through
   the trouble of wearing a costume, but put a jacket over your
   costume.

6. What are some of your favorite webcomics, if any?
   My wife makes webcomics. I like them. www.topdrawercomics.com

7. If you could have one Inspector-Gadget-style bionic attachment, what
   would it be and what would you do with it?
   The first thing that came to mind is bicycle wheels. They would pop
   out and I would pedal to wherever I'm going.
   
8. If you learned the zombie apocalypse was going to erupt tomorrow, what
   would you do today?
   I would go to my grandpa's house in Ohio to arm myself. He's a gun collector
   so he was a lot of rifles. I think having an ample supply of guns and ammo
   is a good idea. Then I would meet up with friends and family to team-up
   and defend ourselves against the zombies and vigilantes.
