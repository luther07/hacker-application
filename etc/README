Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range?

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next
   six months that we should know about?
   No

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?
   No, I have a dog too.

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted,
   Halloween or otherwise.
   I was a mummy for halloween a few years ago. I wore tight-fitting 
   clothes. Then I was wrapped in fabric strips. I had white makeup 
   covering my face and dark circles around my eyes.

6. What are some of your favorite webcomics, if any?
   My wife makes webcomics. I like them. www.topdrawercomics.com

7. If you could have one Inspector-Gadget-style bionic attachment, what
   would it be and what would you do with it?
   The first thing that came to mind is bicycle wheels. They would pop
   out and I would pedal to wherever I'm going.
   
8. If you learned the zombie apocalypse was going to erupt tomorrow, what
   would you do today?
   I think I would go to my grandpa's house in Ohio. He's a gun collector
   so he was a lot of rifles. I think having a ready supply of guns and ammo
   is a good idea. Then I would meet up with friends and family and work
   together to defend ourselves against the zombies and vigilantes.
