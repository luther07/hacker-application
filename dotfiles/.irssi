This is not my .irssi file.
I use the irssi client for chatting on IRC and jabber servers.
I primarily use irssi at work, running on a remote machine, not my personal machine.
I ssh into a remote linux machine and run screen and irssi. With screen and irssi
I remain logged into chat servers 24x7x365. So I stay connected to an IRC server
that runs locally on the remote machine and I stay connected to our corporate 
jabber server. All of my customizations are at work on that remote machine.
My .irssi file mainly just contains config information about the servers and
channels I use. It would contain passwords, which I shouldn't share.
